# repo-pattern-template

This is a demo application and will only be used in demonstrations of Wise Consulting As's new repo- code pattern.

This application is written in Asp.Net Core, uses Vue (v2.6) as it frontend Javascript framework, and Bootstrap 5.
Vue 2.6 was choosen in favor of the newly released Vue 3 due to it's support of using multiple spa apps (as this pattern uses one spa app per page, insted of the convensional one spa app with multiple pages).
